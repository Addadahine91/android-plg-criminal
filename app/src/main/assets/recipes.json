      "category": "Criminal Damage",
      "facts": "A was seen to have spat on a police officer’s rain jacket, during the course of being escorted from one location to another. The rain coat was used as evidence at the hearing and it had a faint mark on it where the spit had supposedly landed. The prosecution’s case relied on the fact that the coat needed dry cleaning and that it had been rendered imperfect as a result of this.",
      "judgment": "The appeal against A’s conviction for criminal damage was allowed as it was found that there was no case to answer in this instance. There had been no attempt made by the officer to clean the rain jacket and if there had been, it could have been wiped with a damp cloth, which would have more than likely removed the mark with no stain remaining and no permanent damage. It was held that this might have been different had the material been more delicate, such as a wedding dress, or the material had stained and it required dry cleaning. Ultimately, it was such minor damage that it was not enough to trigger a penalty under the Criminal Damage Act 1971.",

      "facts": "A, a nine year old boy, was discovered to have numerous bruises following an examination by a paediatrician, which indicated that A had been beaten with a garden cane on more than one occasion with considerable force. A's stepfather, F, was charged under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 section 47 with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. At trial, F successfully claimed the English law defence that A's beating was reasonable chastisement and was acquitted. A took the case to the European Court of Human Rights.",
      "judgment": "The beating of A was of sufficient severity to amount to inhuman or degrading treatment under Article 3. Sufficient severity for Article 3 of the ECHR to apply depends on the circumstances of the case including the nature and context and physical and mental effects of the ill treatment, its duration, and the victim's age, sex and state of health. The UK Government had violated Article 3 by failing to provide adequate protection for children under the English law of chastisement.",

      "facts": "The defendant was a policewoman who was mistakenly paid an extra £74 in her wages by direct debit into her bank account. The employer made no demand for repayment. The defendant initially didn’t know about the overpayment but there was some evidence that she later discovered the error and decided to say nothing about it. However, she didn’t remove the money from her bank account.",
      "judgment": "The Court held that the £74 in question amounted to a “thing in action” in terms of section 4(1) of the Theft Act 1968 and was therefore “property” which was capable of being stolen. Furthermore, section 5(4) of the 1968 Act applied because the money had been received as a result of the mistake of another and in accordance with that section there was an obligation to make restoration. In the circumstances, this obligation to restore became operative from the moment that the policewoman had become aware of the error.",

      "facts": "This case arose from the Southall train crash in which 7 people died. The driver was an experienced driver, but no second competent person was with him. Two safety devices were fitted to prevent the train passing a signal, however, both were turned off. The driver failed to notice two yellow signals and consequently was travelling too fast to be able to stop in time at the red signal. The train driver and the train company were prosecuted on 7 counts of manslaughter. The trial judge, Scott Baker J, ruled that it was a condition precedent to a conviction for gross negligence manslaughter, for a guilty mind to be proved.",
      "judgment": "A defendant can be properly convicted of manslaughter by gross negligence in the absence of evidence as the defendant's state of mind. The Adomako test is objective, but a defendant who is reckless may well be the more readily found to be grossly negligent to a criminal degree. Lord Justice Rose: 'On this question, we accept the submissions of both Mr Lissack and Mr Caplan. They lead to the conclusion that question 1 must be answered 'Yes'. Although there may be cases where the defendant's state of mind is relevant to the jury's consideration when assessing the grossness and criminality of his conduct, evidence of his state of mind is not a pre-requisite to a conviction for manslaughter by gross negligence.'",

      "facts": "The appellant, a lorry driver, crashed into some cars parked on the hard shoulder of a motorway. Two people were killed. He raised the defence of non-insane automatism based on 'driving without awareness' induced by 'repetitive visual stimulus experienced on long journeys on straight flat roads'. The defence of automatism was left to the jury and the defendant was acquitted. The Attorney General referred a point of law to the Court of Appeal as to whether such a condition could found a defence of automatism.",
      "judgment": "The defence of automatism should not have been left to the jury and that the state described as 'driving without awareness' was not capable of founding a defence of automatism. Lord Taylor CJ: 'As the authorities … show, the defence of automatism requires that there was a total destruction of voluntary control on the defendant's part. Impaired, reduced or partial control is not enough. Professor Brown [who gave expert evidence for the respondent] accepted that someone 'driving without awareness' within his description, retains some control. He would be able to steer the vehicle and usually to react and return to full awareness when confronted by significant stimuli.'",

B was charged with murder of S, but was acquitted after it was held that he could not in law be convicted of murder or manslaughter as a result of harm done to a child in utero, and that there could be no transferred malice of the intent to harm from the mother to the foetus.",
      "judgment": "B could be convicted of manslaughter but not of murder. B did not have the mens rea for murder and the concept of transferred malice was inapplicable to the circumstances of this case. However, B satisfied the three elements of unlawful act manslaughter: (1) he had the sufficient mens rea of intention to do an unlawful and dangerous act of stabbing the mother, (2) all reasonable people would recognise the risk that some harm would result, and (3) death was caused by the act. The fact that the injury was not directed at the person who died as a result did not negate liability for manslaughter.",

      "judgment": "Assault was defined as an act where a person intentionally or recklessly causes harm through unlawful violence. The Attorney-General opined that violence in a public place, other than in sport, amounted to a breach of the peace and was unlawful. To “unlawfully” wound a person is also a requirement to for an assault charge under s 20 of the Act.

It was also required to be proven that a defendant’s will had been overpowered at the time the crime was committed. Limits on the defence of duress were defined in that, if a murder was committed under even the most serious of duress, it would not be a justification. Taking a life to save one’s own or another was not considered to be covered by the defence of duress, as murder was said to be a crime too heinous. It was found that Whelan had been subjected to an immediate threat of violence and his crime was receiving stolen goods. It was not a crime as serious as murder.",

On the day in question they had both been to the pub in the afternoon. He returned early because of an argument. She returned in the evening and announced that she had had sex with another man. He hacked her to death with an axe. At his trial he raised the defence of provocation. He wished to rely on his alcoholism, depression and other personality traits. The jury convicted him of murder.",

His conviction was again quashed and a manslaughter conviction was substituted. The Attorney General sought leave to appeal arguing the decision in Smith (Morgan) was wrong and should not apply in Jersey. The appeal was allowed.

He had spent some time in a mental hospital for which he blamed his wife. On his release he went out and brought a bottle of whiskey and a knife. He intended to use the knife to kill his wife and brought the whiskey as he knew that this would make him aggressive to the extent that he would be able to kill. He drank the whiskey and killed his wife with the knife and a hammer. He was convicted of murder and appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal N.I on the grounds of a mis-direction. His conviction was quashed.",
      "judgment": "The Attorney General appealed to the House of Lords on the grounds that the defence of insanity was not open to him because before taking the drink, when there was no defect in his reason, he had clearly evinced an intention to kill his wife and any temporary derangement of his reason at the time of the killing was the result of his own voluntary act in taking the drink. Appeal allowed. The conviction restored.

      "facts": "The defendant assaulted his wife with a hammer. He had no previous history of violence and no apparent motive. He was charged with causing grievous bodily harm contrary to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861. The defendant argued that the attack was the result of loss of consciousness linked to arteriosclerosis, with the hardening of the arteries causing congestion of blood in his brain. This was used by the defence as grounds for a defence of automatism. The trial judge however directed the jury that the appropriate defence was one of insanity.",
      "judgment": "The court held that hardening of the arteries could amount to a disease of the mind due to its effect on a person’s reasoning ability. Essentially the court was not concerned with how a defendant got to a certain state of mind (through a physical or psychological impairment), but that he reached that state and was in it at the time of committing the offence. The term “disease of the mind” was designed, inter alia, to limit the effect of the term “defect of reason” so as not to permit stupidity to act as a defence.

The court referred to Stevens v Gourley (1859) 141 ER 742 which pre-dated the Act and in which it was held that a building was ‘a structure of considerable size and intended to be permanent or at least to endure for a considerable time’ (per Byles J at 112). The container fulfilled this criteria as it was likely to remain there for the foreseeable future. Therefore, it was a building for the purposes of the 1968 Act.

The woman decided to walk away, but the police officer was intent on stopping her and in order to do so, grabbed her arm in order to prevent her from walking away. Under the Street Offences Act 1959 c.57, the police officer had no power to detain the woman. The woman struggled with the police officer and scratched him. She was charged with assaulting a police office in the course of his duty.",
      "judgment": "It was held that the police officer was acting outside the scope of his powers as he had no power to arrest the woman in that situation and therefore, was acting outside of the scope of his duties as a police officer. There was no question therefore of assaulting a police officer in the course of his duty. It was held further that the grabbing on the part of the police officer, without the power to make an arrest, amounted to an unlawful assault (a battery). The woman had been entitled to resist as an action of self-defence. Her conviction was therefore quashed.",

The trial judge directed the jury: 'A person cannot rely on the defence of duress if he has voluntarily and with full knowledge of its nature joined a criminal group which he was aware might bring pressure on him of a violent kind or require him if necessary to commit offences to obtain money where he himself had defaulted to the criminal group in payment to the criminal group.'",
      "judgment": "This was held to be a misdirection. The appeals were allowed and the convictions quashed. What a defendant has to be aware of is the risk that the group might try to coerce him into committing criminal offences of the type for which he is being tried by the use of violence or threats of violence. The purpose of the pressure has to be to coerce the accused into committing a criminal offence of the type for which he is being tried. NB this position of the law was stated to be erroneous in R v Hasan [2005]",

Lord Hutton set the appropriate direction to be given to juries where there exists an abnormality of the mind in addition to intoxication: 'Assuming that the defence have established that the defendant was suffering from mental abnormality as described in section 2, the important question is: did that abnormality substantially impair his mental responsibility for his acts in doing the killing? You know that before he carried out the killing the defendant had had a lot to drink. Drink cannot be taken into account as something which contributed to his mental abnormality and to any impairment of mental responsibility arising from that abnormality'.",

He then stated that due to his excessive tiredness and the constant noise of the baby he lost his control and pressed down harder than he meant to at the time he was kneeling on the baby's head.

It is further admitted that there was in this case no such excuse, unless the killing was justified by what has been called 'necessity'. But the temptation to the act which existed here was not what the law has ever called necessity. Nor is this to be regretted. Though law and morality are not the same, and many things may be immoral which are not necessarily illegal, yet the absolute divorce of law from morality would be of fatal consequence; and such divorce would follow if the temptation to murder in this case were to be held by law an absolute defence of it…..'",

Silence could act as a threat where it was done in a way which could induce fear in the victim; where the victim is afraid that the threat will be acted on in the near future, this could amount to an assault.

Kabadi came at Karimi with a knife and shouted ‘Besharif’ an insulting phrase meaning you have no honour. Karimi then disarmed him and stabbed him to death.

Essentially the court was not concerned with how a defendant got to a certain state of mind (through a physical or psychological impairment), but that he reached that state and was in it at the time of committing the offence.

Moreover, a charge of ABH does not necessarily require that the accused has personally committed an assault; rather it suffices that they committed an illegal act and it be reasonably foreseeable that this act may cause harm.

A month before the killing the appellant told his psychiatrist he was having violent fantasies and experienced sexual arousal from violence. At his trial he advanced a plea of self-defence. His counsel discussed the issue of diminished responsibility but the defendant and his counsel believed that if this was also raised it would prejudice the outcome with regards to self-defence and reveal that he was dangerous. The appellant later admitted that the self-defence plea was fabricated. The appellant appealed raising the diagnosis as fresh evidence to found a defence of diminished responsibility.",

The test to be applied was whether an ordinary prudent bystander would, at the time when the fire was started, have perceived an obvious risk that property would be damaged and that life would thereby be endangered. The fact that there may have been special features which prevented the risk from materialising was irrelevant.",

(2) The court’s jurisdiction, was founded in a declaration under the Rules of the Supreme Court (SI 1965/1776), as requested by the mother. (3) The declaration procedure was the correct one, although amendments should be made to allow this to apply to circumstances such as these.",

      "category": "Theft",
      "facts": "The defendant, Ricketts, was arrested after taking bags from outside a charity shop and from the bins at the rear of the shop and putting them into his vehicle. On interview he admitted he was taking them to sell. He was charged with theft under the Theft Act 1968 and was committed by the magistrates to Crown Court. He sought judicial review of this decision in the High Court claiming there was insufficient evidence against him.",
      "judgment": "The bags taken from the bins outside Oxfam could be taken to be in Oxfam’s possession at the time he appropriated them. However, with regard to the bags taken from outside BHF, no possession or proprietary interest could be taken to arise from them simply being left in the vicinity. However, it didn’t follow that the items had been abandoned. The donor intended the items to be a gift to the BHF, they had attempted delivery of the gift, and the gift would be complete once BHF took possession of the items. The items still belonged to the donor until BHF took possession.",

Following complaints as to the quality of the milk, one morning, Roper and a police officer watched Knott as he proceeded to pour water into the milk which he intended to sell on to his customers. The entire portion of milk had been spoiled and this was to the value of 10s and 8d. The magistrate was of the opinion that Roper had acted fraudulently to increase the bulk of milk to sell on and keep profits.",
      "judgment": "The court had no doubt that Knott had wilfully damaged the milk and this was with the fraudulent motive of gaining an advantage for himself. The judges held that the decision in Hall v Richardson could not be followed due to error and therefore the appeal must be allowed. The case was subsequently remitted to the magistrates to convict Knott.",

It was customary for police officers to wear an armlet whilst on duty but this constable had removed his. The appellant therefore believed he was off duty.

      "judgment": "In the present case, the defendant had a clear intention to cause fear, and that intended effect materialised as his actions frightened Miss M, causing her to scream and be terrified of the defendant’s potential actions. It is sufficient to identify the intention of the victim to cause a state of fear and created a situation where the basis of fear instilled in the victim was as to what the defendant would do next.

Unless it is the clear intention of Parliament that an offence is an absolute or regulatory offence (imposing strict liability), the presumption of mens rea prevails for ‘true’ crime offences. The words ‘being concerned in the management’ under Section 5(b) had to be read as importing a mens rea of knowledge as to the use of the premises for the prohibited purpose, therefore the offence was a ‘true crime,’ not a regulatory crime.
